## DESCRIPTION
 
As a business owner, I want to be abel to manage and view the departments, roles, and employees in my comnpany so that I can organize and plan my business. We built this project to have a concrete database of employee information within our network to be able to handle small or large company portfolios. This application solves the need for a third-party platform to handle the information for our business. During this project, we learned how to use asciiart-logo and console.table to show us organized information within the terminal. This application stands out because it can be worked on in the future to build further company information.
